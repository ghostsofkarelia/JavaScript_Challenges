## Synopsis

These are a couple of challenges that I was asked to code in JavaScript. They're an eclectic bunch of problem statements and I had a nice time coding them. I would like to present my
solution to them and just have them out there to remind me of what a fun time I had. They're all supposed to run in a jsFiddle as I didn't have time to setup an environment for them but
which is simple work to do

## Networks
